`TrialSimulator` is an R package for conducting patient-level simulation of randomized clinical trial. 
Unit test is usually not sufficient to verify its correctness. Instead, we run patient-level simulation 
of massive replicates to compare empirical power, analysis time, expected number of events, etc. to 
their analytic values. This method is usually computational intensive and is infeasible to be included 
in the R package. We use this repository to host all testing documents, which will be re-generated using 
the `TrialSimulator` package whenever a major update is available.
