`gMCP` (and `gMCPLite`) is a well-established R package implementing the 
graphical testing procedure under a group sequential design. `graphicalMCP` 
releases a vignette showing that it can produce testing results that are 
identical or similar to `gMCP`. However, current version of `graphicalMCP` 
only supports testing a graph at a given time (i.e., the length of argument
`p` of `graphicalMCP::graph_test_shortcut` is equal to the number of 
hypotheses in the graph); additional efforts are needed from users to 
implement customized codes to adapt it to group sequential design. 

This vignette uses the simulation setting in `graphicalMCP` where five 
hypotheses are tested on random graphs. It shows that, at a given time, 
`TrialSimulator` can reproduce testing results of `graphicalMCP` through 
its `S6` class `GraphicalTesting`. Please note that `GraphicalTesting` is 
able to carry out full graphical testing under a group sequential design, 
which will be tested elsewhere. No comparison is made with `gMCP` directly. 

Unlike `graphicalMCP`, `TrialSimulator::GraphicalTesting` is based on nominal 
p-values at each stages. Neither adjusted nor sequential p-values are computed. 
Thus, we only compare testing decisions of hypotheses (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). 

```{r ljgai, class.source="fold-show"}
set.seed(1234)
alpha <- 0.025
identical <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
  graph <- random_graph(5)
  if(runif(1) > .5){
    p <- runif(5, 0, 1.5 * alpha)
  }else{
    p <- runif(5, 0, .3)
  }
  
  gmcp <-
    graph_test_shortcut(graph, p, alpha = alpha)$outputs$rejected
  
  ## Note that we only test a graph at a given time, so alpha_spending 
  ## and planned_max_info can be set to arbitrary valid values
  gt <- GraphicalTesting$new(
    alpha = graph$hypotheses * alpha, 
    transition = graph$transitions, 
    ## any valid characters would work
    alpha_spending = rep('asOF', 5),
    ## any integers would work
    planned_max_info = rep(100, 5), 
    hypotheses = paste0('H', 1:5),
    silent = TRUE
  )
  
  stats <- 
    data.frame(hypotheses = paste0('H', 1:5), 
               p = p, 
               is_final = rep(TRUE, 5), 
               ## info should be identical to max_info 
               ## as if we are testing at the final stage
               ## to use all allocated alpha
               info = rep(100, 5), 
               max_info = rep(100, 5)
    )

  res <- gt$get_current_testing_results() %>% arrange(hypothesis)
  
  identical <- c(
    identical,
    all.equal(
      ifelse(gmcp, 'reject', 'accept') %>% unname(), 
      res$decision, 
      tolerance = 1e-7)
  )

all(identical)
